# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using Pygame.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```shell
     cd tic-tac-toe

3. Install the required dependencies:

  ```shell
     pip install pygame


## How It Works

The game utilizes Pygame library to create a graphical user interface for playing Tic Tac Toe. Here's how the game works:

1. The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid on the Pygame window.

2. Two players take turns to make their moves. Player 1 is represented by 'X' symbol, and Player 2 is represented by 'O' symbol.

3. To make a move, the player clicks on one of the empty tiles on the game board.

4. The program detects the player's click and fills the corresponding tile with the player's symbol.

5. The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or if all tiles are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.

6. After the game ends, the players have the option to restart and play again.
